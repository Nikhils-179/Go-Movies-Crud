# Go-Movies-Crud

This Project uses golang to perform crud operation over a list of movies

I have used gorilla/mux : a popular third-party package for the Go programming language (Golang) used for building web applications and APIs. 
It provides powerful and flexible routing capabilities for handling HTTP requests and defining routes for different endpoints in your web application.
